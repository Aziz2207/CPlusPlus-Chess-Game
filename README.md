# C++ Chess-Game
## Overview
This project is a chess game developed in C++ using the Qt framework for the graphical user interface. The game allows users to play chess locally, alternating turns between the white and black pieces. Although there is no AI or bot to play against, the game provides a great platform for two players to enjoy chess on the same device.

The interface includes a chessboard and a button to start a new game. At the end of the match, the interface displays the winner.

## Features
- Player vs. Player gameplay: Players alternate turns between the white and black pieces.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built with Qt, featuring an interactive chessboard and a button to start a new game.
- Winner display: The game announces the winner when the match concludes.
